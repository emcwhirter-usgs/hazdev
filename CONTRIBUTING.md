# Welcome!

We're glad you're thinking about contributing to a USGS Hazdev open source
project. If you're unsure about anything, ask â€” or submit the issue or pull
request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).


## Guidelines

### Submitting an issue

When submitting an issue, please describe the feature or error with steps to

deem this issue, bug or feature complete. Include images or other notes if they
will assist in clarifying the request.
