[License](License.md)

## Getting Started

Many of our projects use [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for managing
dependencies and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for task automation, which
includes minification, compilation, unit testing, linting and previewing work
locally in a browser. Run these commands from the desired project's install
directory.

Get dependencies

        npm install

Preview in a browser

        grunt

### Having trouble getting started?

If this is your first time using **grunt**, you need to install the grunt
command line interface globally.

    npm install -g grunt-cli
