## Getting Started

Many of our projects use `node` for managing dependencies and
[grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for task automation, which includes minification,
compilation, unit testing, linting and previewing work locally in a browser.

Run `npm install` to get dependencies

To preview in a browser, run `grunt` from the desired project's install
directory.

### Having trouble getting started?

If this is your first time using **grunt**, you need to install the grunt
command line interface globally.

    npm install -g grunt-cli
